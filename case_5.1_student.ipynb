This is because bike_nr is assigned before any trips are taken with that bike; hence, every other feature of the dataset is necessarily generated after the bike number is assigned. This means that there is no rhyme or reason for what bike_nr should be based on the other columns (because its creation preceded all the others), so there is no reason to expect a reasonable value to result from interpolation.\n",
    "#### Given that at best we can only fill bike_nr with a meaningless filler value, it may be tempting to remove rows without bike_nr entirely. However, removing a row entirely tends to be the nuclear option and in the absence of a very clear and limited use case for the dataset going forward, it may result in us regretting our choice once we realize that some data we cut out might actually be useful. For example, if in some future analyses the client cares a fair amount about aggregate statistics relating to many or all the trips, then a specific bike_nr value is not important and we can still get useful analysis by replacing each bike_nr with a \"Not Found\", whereas we could well be missing that analysis if we cut out too much data.

    "<p>When cleaning data, one very common problem is missing data. We learned a few ways of dealing with missing data and when these methods tend to be appropriate:</p>\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>Removing the rows with missing data entirely is a nuclear option that only makes sense when you have a clear and very limited use case for the dataset.</li>\n",
    "<li>Replacing the missing values with a meaningless filler like \"Not found\" or 0 makes sense if you need to preserve the other data in those rows but either cannot sensibly fill in or don't particularly care about the missing values in that specific column.</li>\n",
    "<li>Interpolating the missing values makes sense when you need to preserve elements of the underlying distribution of the data in that column.</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "<p>We also saw that for large datasets, working with a small subset of the data is a useful tool for gaining intuition about the dataset and rapidly iterating on the cleaning process. This intuition gathering element cannot be emphasized enough; in fact, many steps in our cleaning process involved elements of exploratory data analysis, via generating summary statistics. Running cleaning steps on the entirety of a very large dataset is time consuming and can bog down the EDA that is essential to cleaning. In future cases, you will see further evidence of EDA in action during wrangling &amp; cleaning.</p>"
